### Introduction
SignalR communication Demo based on .Net 6.0, including WPF server, Web server, WPF client project code

Notice:

1. The WPF server does not support Win7 and below systems and will report a Dll error

2. Currently does not support sending information from the server to the client (had submitted to SignalR Issue)
