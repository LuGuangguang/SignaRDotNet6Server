SignalR C/S Demo based on .Net 6.0, including WPF server, Web server, WPF client project code;

It can help you build SignalR C/S project fastly and easily;

Especially it is very suitable for the rapid construction and deployment of LAN communication;

Notice:

1. The WPF server does not support Win7 and below systems and will report a Dll error
